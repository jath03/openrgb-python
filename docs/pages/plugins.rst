Plugins
=======

OpenRGB recently (0.81) added support for SDK clients to interact with plugins.  This
means that you can control plugins from the SDK.  I wrote a basic integration with
the effects plugin as a proof of concept, but it is very flexible and can support more
advanced use cases if someone writes the code.  Any plugins that support SDK
interactions will be listed under the :any:`plugins<OpenRGBClient.plugins>`
